Goldie The Fish has been holding his breath for hours on end. He will stay underwater all day long, but he always comes out top of the water. He loves to swim, eat and sleep. He is always quiet and never complains.

Red The Apple is a family favorite. Red is a seasonal part of the team. Red is usally visiting during the late Spring and Summer time of year. He is always reminding us to eat healthy and that fruits are good for the body and mind.
